## Convert Excel to PDF via Node.js
```js
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var assert = require('assert');
const localPath = "../TestData/";
describe('cellsWorkbookPutConvertWorkbook', function() {
  it('should call cellsWorkbookPutConvertWorkbook successfully', function() {
    const cellsApi =new api.CellsApi(AppSid, AppKey);
    const filename = "Book1.xlsx";
    var data =fs.createReadStream(localPath  + filename);
    var req = new model.UploadFileRequest();
    req.path = "Temp/" + filename;
    req.file = data;

    return cellsApi.uploadFile(req)
      .then(() => {
        var req = new model.CellsWorkbook_PutConvertWorkbookRequest({
          workbook : fs.createReadStream(localPath  + filename),
          format : "pdf",
        });

        return cellsApi.cellsWorkbookPutConvertWorkbook(req)
          .then((result) => {
            expect(result.body.toString().length).to.greaterThan(0);
          });
      });
  });
});
```

## Hide Excel Columns via Node.js

```js
const { CellsApi, Cells_PostHideWorksheetColumnsRequest } = require("asposecellscloud");

AppSid = ""
AppKey = ""
cellsApi = new CellsApi(AppSid, AppKey);
filename = "Book1.xlsx"

var req = new Cells_PostHideWorksheetColumnsRequest();
req.name = filename;
req.sheetName = "Sheet1";
req.startColumn = 1;
req.totalColumns = 2;
req.folder = "";

return cellsApi.cellsPostHideWorksheetColumns(req)
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result)
    });
```

## Merge Worksheets in the Cloud via Node.js

```js
const { CellsApi, Cells_PostWorksheetMergeRequest } = require("asposecellscloud");

AppSid = ""
AppKey = ""
cellsApi = new CellsApi(AppSid, AppKey);
filename = "Book1.xlsx"

var req = new Cells_PostWorksheetMergeRequest();
req.name = filename;
req.sheetName = "Sheet1";
req.startRow = 1;
req.startColumn = 1;
req.totalRows = 4;
req.totalColumns = 4;
req.folder = "";

return cellsApi.cellsPostWorksheetMerge(req)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result)
  });
```
